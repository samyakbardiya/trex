# TReX

**TReX** is a Text User Interface (TUI) tool for writing, visualizing, and
testing Regular Expressions (RegEx). This terminal-based application uses a
keyboard-driven interface to allow users to create and evaluate RegEx patterns
efficiently.

## Why TReX?

**T** from the TUI and **REX** from the **RegEx**, hence the TReX, :t-rex: roar!

Because sometimes you just want to quickly test out a regex without fussing
through multiple browser tabs and searching for the right online tool. TReX was
created to let you see exactly how your regex interacts with your stringâ€”in one
simple, elegant terminal application.

## Features

- Written in Go, for efficient performance
- Capability to load external files for testing purposes
- Keyboard-driven interface, so that you don't need to use a mouse :)
- Mouse-support for those who still want to use it

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://go.dev/)

### Steps

- **Clone the repository:**

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/samyakbardiya/trex.git
  cd trex
  ```

- **Build the application:**

  ```sh
  go install
  go build
  ```

- **Optionally, you can copy the binary to your PATH:**

  ```sh
  cp ./trex ~/.local/bin
  ```

- **Verify the installation:**

  ```sh
  ./trex --help
  ./trex --version
  ```

## Usage

- To start TReX:

  ```sh
  trex
  ```

- To load a file into TReX:

  ```sh
  trex file.txt
  ```

## Roadmap

- Editable text area instead of read-only view
- Local history, similar to your shell history, which can be navigated via
  up & down arrow key
- Syntax highlighting for the RegEx input.

## Implementation

TReX is developed in **Go** and leverages the following libraries:

- [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for building the TUI.
- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for command-line functionality.
- [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) for styling the interface.
- [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) for additional TUI utilities
